# Azure Infrastructure Operations: Deploy a web server in Azure
# author: sandeep vuzzini

### Introduction

This project contains infrastructure to host a web application on Microsoft Azure. It uses Terraform to manage resources, Packer to build an
image to be used for the virtual machine and creates the necessary network resources to route traffic.

The template prompts the user for the amount of instances to be created within the Availability set. The virtual machine instance count is spread across the Availability set and load is distributed with the use of a Load Balancer.

The template includes the creation of a Virtual network, subnet and public IP address. It blocks external internet internet traffic with the use of Network Security Groups by default.

Follow the instructions below is setup the environment.

All commands are run through Azure CLI (see Dependencies section)

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have all dependencies installed and Microsoft accounts (see Dependencies section)
3. Run commands to create resources (see Instructions section for commands)

### Dependencies

1. Create an [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Install the [Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
3. Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads)
4. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Instructions

#### 1. Create service principal for Terraform and Packer [Create service Principal](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/service_principal_client_secret.html)

#### 2. Set ARM environment variables:

It is best to add these variables to your ./bashrc file to persist if the terminal is closed

    $ export ARM_CLIENT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    $ export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    $ export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    $ export ARM_TENANT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"

#### 3. Create resource group to store Packer Image:

    az group create -l eastus -n packer-image-rg

| Flag | Meaning                            |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- |
| -l   | Your location                      |
| -n   | Name of the image you are creating |

#### 4. Update Packer variables (optional):

If you chose a different name for the resource groups you will need to update the variables in the 'server.json' file.

```json
    ...
    "variables": {
        ...
        "resource_group": "packer-image-rg",
        "image_name": "packer-image"
        ...
    },
    ...
```

#### 5. Build packer image

    packer build server.json

#### 6. Get Image ID

Get the ID for the image you just created, to be used in the Terraform template

    az image show packer-image

#### 7. Edit Terraform variables

Edit variables in the 'variables.tf' to reflect your information.

The following items should be updated:

- prefix
- username
- password
- location (should match image resource group location)
- image_id

```hcl
variable "prefix" {
  description = "The prefix which should be used for all resources in this example"
  default     = "YOUR PREFIX"
}

variable "username" {
  description = "Enter username to associate with the machine"
  default     = "YOUR USER NAME"

}

variable "password" {
  description = "Enter password to use to access the machine"
  default     = "YOUR PASSWORD"

}

variable "location" {
  description = "The Azure Region in which all resources in this example should be created."
  default     = "YOUR LOCATION"
}

variable "image_id" {
  description = "Enter the ID for the image which will be used for creating the Virtual Machines"
  default     = "YOUR IMAGE ID HERE"
}

...

```

Instance count will be prompted on creation of the resources.

#### 7. Run Terraform

    terraform plan
    terraform apply

### Output

Following the Terraform service principal authentication guidelines creates the following resources:

- Azure Service Principal

Running the Packer commands creates the following resources:

- Image resource group
- Managed virtual machine image

The following resources are created with the Terraform template:

- Resource Group
- Virtual Network
- Subnet
- Network Security Group
- Security group rules
- Public IP
- Load Balancer
- Backend Address pools
- Availability Set
- Network Interface Card(s)
- Virtual Machine(s)
- Azure Managed Disk(s)
